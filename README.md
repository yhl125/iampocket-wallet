## About
iampocket is a seedless wallet built using Lit protocol PKP (Programmable Key Pairs), for everyone's needs. Users have multiple login options available, including Google, Discord, Email, SMS, and Webauthn (Face ID, Touch ID). 

With ZeroDev wallet, you can seamlessly operate across various blockchain networks such as Arbitrum One, Optimism, Ethereum Goerli, Polygon Mumbai, Arbitrum Goerli, and Optimism Goerli.And Biconomy wallet offers compatibility with Linea Goerli and Polygon zkEVM Testnet. And you can use ERC-20 Paymaster with transfer using stackup's testnet gas token.

Using ZeroDev wallet, 4337 contract is automatically deployed once you initiate a transaction. This contract facilitates connectivity and enables the use of DApps that support ERC-1271 via WalletConnect.

Please note that your ERC20 token balances are periodically updated at 30-second intervals through Covalent, so slight delays may occur.
